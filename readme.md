> ### [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) and [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) (as front-end) and [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)** (as back-end), including routing, authentication, CRUD operations, authentication, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the styleguides & best practices promoted by these frameworks.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

This project uses the classic three-tier architecture:

```
╭─────────────╮           ╭──────────────╮           ╭──────────────╮
│  Front-end  ├───────────▶   Back-end   ├───────────▶   Database   │
│  (Dioxus)   │           │    (Axum)    │           │ (PostgreSQL) │
╰─────────────╯           ╰──────────────╯           ╰──────────────╯
```

# Getting started

First, have the database available as described in [backend's readme](./backend/readme.md) by starting it and run the database migration.

For local development and usage, just run `./run_dev.sh` script that starts both the front-end and the back-end.
